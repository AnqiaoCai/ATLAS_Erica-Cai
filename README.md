In 2021, there are 38.4 million people of all ages who have diabetes, accounting for 11.6% of the US population (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2025). This shows the widespread of diabetes, which is a significant public health issue. Developing diabetes is influenced by different factors, including medical records and personal data. Thus, I want to implement four classification models, including XGBoost, logistic regression model, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and random forest to classify individuals as healthy or not healthy (pre-diabetic or diabetic) based on the available data. After this, we use model evaluation metrics such as accuracy to compare the performance of the models in order to choose the best one. Users can use the best model to predict their diabetes status. I built an interface based on this model by Gradio.
